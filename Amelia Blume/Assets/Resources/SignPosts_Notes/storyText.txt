:: recovered text from the topographical anomaly
Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dimlit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been. In the black water with the sun shining at midnight, those fruit shall come ripe and in the darkness of that which is golden shall split open to reveal the revelation of the fatal softness in the earth. The shadows of the abyss are like the petals of a monstrous flower that shall blossom within the skull and expand the mind beyond what any man can bear, but whether it decays under the earth or above on green fields, or out to sea or in the very air, all shall come to revelation, and to revel, in the knowledge of the strangling fruit—and the hand of the sinner shall rejoice, for there is no sin in shadow or in light that the seeds of the dead cannot forgive. And there shall be in the planting in the shadows a grace and a mercy from which shall blossom dark flowers, and their teeth shall devour and sustain and herald the passing of an age. That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated it shall walk the world in the bliss of not-knowing. And then there shall be a fire that knows the naming of you, and in the presence of the strangling fruit, its dark flame shall acquire every part of you that remains.

:: 1-1 tutorial dash [Amelia]
This gap is too wide to jump over without falling into that bramble. I could dash across, however. (Right bumper: Dash.)


:: 1-1 mushroom examination a
A crimson mushroom cap lies on the ground.[[1-1 mushroom examination b]]


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius a
Another druid approaches, bearing a stern countenance and a staff of charred oak. Worry lines are etched into his face.[[1-1 Meeting Ignatius b]]


:: 1-2 Audience a
A single massive oak stands at the center of what would otherwise be a clearing. Here presides The Heart of the Woods, bound to the throne of vines he sits on. He holds a birchstaff in his ghastly white hand.[[1-2 Audience b]]


:: 2-1 first deer
A large buck stands ahead, staring blankly into the distance and occasionally letting off an aggravated sort of snort. It seems to be covered in fruiting bodies, a living colony for some kind of fungus.[[2-1 oh deer]]


:: 2-1 Forest Guardian a
The Forest Guardian is slumped over, a massive beast breathing in long, ragged gasps and weakly clutching a young pine sapling that's been pressed into service as a staff.[[2-1 Forest Guardian b]]


:: 2-2 Dour News a
Ignatius is hovering over the Heart of the Woods, cycling through a rapid series of hand gestures and chanting in the peculiar magical syntax used by members of the Circle of Ash. He finishes a chant, but continuing to cycle through the gestures.[[2-2 Dour News b]]


:: 3-2 What Was That [Amelia]
That sounded big...


:: 3-3 Discovered Flower a [Amelia]
The growth of fungus near this flower appears to be inhibited... I may be use this to slow down the corrupted creatures. A slowed creature might have more trouble breaking out of vine bindings.


:: 3-3 guardian murdered a
The woods remain eerily silent, but even the sound of rushing water in the distance has gone.


:: 3-5 strangled deer
A deer lies dead here. Wrapped around it are thick vines, covered in inch-long barbs that have torn the skin and muscle from the bones of the creature. A milk-white film covers the creature's eyes, a sharp contrast to the black ichor still pulsing from its wounds.[[3-5 strangled deer b]]


:: 4-1 Ashes a [action]
<Ignatius appears.>[[4-1 Ashes b]]


:: 4-2 Return to the Heart a
The flames dance all around at the edge of the Heartsgrove, slowly eating through the barriers and wards Ignatius lay himself.[[4-2 Return to the Heart b]]


:: 5-1 Fungus preview
From further within the cave, there's a sound like wet leaves rustling.


:: 5-1 taking the throne a [Amelia]
The woods may recover from this fire in time, but...[[5-1 taking the throne b]]


:: 1-1 tutorial acorn [Amelia]
That cliff is too steep to climb... But if I planted an acorn, I could climb the tree that it would grow instead. (Plant active seed: X Button.)


:: 1-1 mushroom examination b [Amelia]
This fungus smells... oily, and almost like a woodfire. I've never encountered such a thing in all my many years.


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius b [Ignatius]
The trees foretold your arrival, Archdruid. It is good to see your face in this dire season. I am Ignatius, third keeper of the Circle of Ash.[[1-1 Meeting Ignatius c]]


:: 1-2 Audience b [Amelia]
Greetings, lord. I am Amélia, an Archdruid come to aid in healing the sickness in your woods.[[1-2 Audience c]]


:: 2-1 oh deer [Amelia]
If that deer becomes dangerous, I could restrain it with one of the vine seeds in my seed bag. (Select seed: Right Thumbstick)[[2-1 oh deer b]]


:: 2-1 Forest Guardian b [Amelia]
Am I too late? Has the illness crept even here to fell you, mighty one?[[2-1 Forest Guardian c]]


:: 2-2 Dour News b [Ignatius]
Welcome back, Archdruid. What news?[[2-2 Dour News c]]


:: 3-2 Examine Ig Vines [Amelia]
Ignatius must have passed through here recently. This area is empty save for a few scattered fungi and his leftover plants.


:: 3-4 Time to Prepare
There is an unnatural quiet here, as even the occasional sound of birdsong has gone. In the distance there is a faint sound of rushing water.[[3-4 Time to Prepare b]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered b [action]
<Ignatius enters.>


:: 3-5 strangled deer b [Amelia]
This... is an old form of botanomancy, meant to sow only sorrow and death.


:: 4-1 Ashes b [Amelia]
Ignatius, stop this! Think about the consequences of what you're about to do![[4-1 Ashes c]]


:: 4-2 Return to the Heart b [Amelia]
My lord, I will renew the wards and protect you until these fires pass.[[4-2 Return to the Heart c]]


:: 5-1 Humungus Fungus Amungus a
A: What is this... growth, lurking with the roots and shadows?

A mass of slick, shiny fibers is barely visible beyond, adding a reek of something like oil and decay to the ouerve of chthonic odors.

The fibers begin to shift, softly oozing a syrupy red-black fluid as they do so. The fibers connect to a pale white body dotted with bony extrusions and numerous pustules.

/% This speech affectation might be a little over-the-top, I dunno. %/
C: We are... mORRRrrre than a... grrrowth, arRRCHdruid.

A: Then what are you? A vulture, come to pick at the remains of the blessed woods?

C: We are... the rrrrrrrrrRRRightful ownnnersss of these... woodsss.

C: With the ailinnng Hearrrt now... rrremoved, we will have an essstate worthy of... us. Devoid of grrRRREEN, a palace of rrrot forrr us and... only us.

A: I won't let that happen.

C: Won't you, 

<dialogue continues>


:: 5-1 taking the throne b [Amelia]
...these woods were planted by the first druids because of the intersection of leylines that occurs here. The magical energies that course through these woods will accumulate over time without the oversight of a Heart to diffuse them, attracting all manner of dark entities.[[5-1 taking the throne c]]


:: 1-1 tutorial water [Amelia]
There's an acorn in the soil here... I could conjure some water to wet the soil and then shine sunlight upon it once it sprouts. (Conjure Water: B Button. Conjure Sunlight: Y Button.)[[1-1 tutorial water b]]


:: 1-1 examination a
Growing on the side of the tree is a patch of mold, ink-black and dappled with violet.[[1-1 examination b]]


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius c [Amelia]
Greetings, friend. What brings you so far from the Burnt Grove?[[1-1 Meeting Ignatius d]]


:: 1-2 Audience c
The old man gives no sign that he heard, continuing to stare blankly at the ground and breathing raggedly.[[1-2 Audience d]]


:: 2-1 oh deer b [Amelia]
Then, my sunlight magic should be able to cleanse the infection from the animal. (Sunlight / Conversion: Y Button)


:: 2-1 Forest Guardian c
The giant looks up with eyes covered in a milk-white film. It attempts to muster a response, but the only thing to pass its lips are weak breath and several drops of a black ichor that falls to the moss-covered ground.[[2-1 Forest Guardian d]]


:: 2-2 Dour News c [Amelia]
The same corruption that plagues the Heart of the Woods also grips much of the wildlife.[[2-2 Dour News d]]


:: 3-4 Time to Prepare b [Amelia]
That lumbering beast is as stubborn in pursuit as it is big. Forewarned is forearmed, however; I should use this time to prepare defenses.


:: 3-3 guardian murdered c [Amelia]
Ignatius... those bodies, what have you done?[[3-3 guardian murdered d]]


:: 4-1 Ashes c [Ignatius]
I have, Amélia. The illness lurks in every stem, every root... The Heart of the Woods is connected to all of it. He has been strong, but he will succumb to the disease eventually, and by then the blight will have spread to far beyond the confines of this forest.[[4-1 Ashes d]]


:: 4-2 Return to the Heart c
The Heart of the Woods jerks his arm from a phantom pain, but it is restrained by the very roots which connect him with every living thing in the forest.[[4-2 Return to the Heart d]]


:: 5-1 taking the throne c [Amelia]
If I take this chair I could take up that burden myself, but in so doing I will be utterly bound to these woods... for good or ill.[[5-1 taking the throne d]]


:: 1-1 tutorial water b [Amelia]
Once it grows tall enough, I should be able to climb its limbs.


:: 1-1 examination b [Amelia]
Odd... These conditions don't favor mold.


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius d [Ignatius]
The same thing that surely brings you here, Archdruid. A dark presence lurks over this forest... the winds blowing through are heavy with death.[[1-1 Meeting Ignatius e]]


:: 1-2 Audience d [Ignatius]
The roots sing his pain. I do not know if he is even capable of hearing us.[[1-2 Audience e]]


:: 2-1 Forest Guardian d [Amelia]
Rest now, and close your eyes. You have served the woods well, and will be welcomed into the roots and boughs.[[2-1 Forest Guardian e]]


:: 2-2 Dour News d [Ignatius]
Then, the greenbond? What does the Forest Guardian advise?[[2-2 Dour News e]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered d [Ignatius]
Only what's necessary, Archdruid. This corruption spreads every minute these creatures breathe. They must be culled if the woods are to be saved.[[3-3 guardian murdered e]]


:: 4-1 Ashes d [Amelia]
With... without a Heart, the leyline would be uncontrolled. The forest will fall to evil![[4-1 Ashes e]]


:: 4-2 Return to the Heart d [Heart]
Amélia... no. It is the end of my season, and you would not survive the heat any more than the sun would walk backwards across the sky.[[4-2 Return to the Heart e]]


:: 5-1 taking the throne d [Amelia]
But what of Ignatius? He should be brought to answer for his actions today and... if not me, then who?


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius e [Amelia]
There is a great sickness here, yes, and it is only growing. I seek now to make an audience with The Heart of the Woods.[[1-1 Meeting Ignatius f]]


:: 1-2 Audience e
The Heart of the Woods lets out a long wheeze, though it's not clear whether it's an attempt at speech.[[1-2 Audience f]]


:: 2-1 Forest Guardian e
The Forest Guardian takes in a deep breath and slowly exhales before becoming still. There is no motion, but for the glistening of the dying sunlight on the pool of black ichor surrounding the giant's corpse.


:: 2-2 Dour News e [Amelia]
Nothing. The greenbond has been severed.[[2-2 Dour News f]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered e [Amelia]
That's not true! I've cleansed these animals myself... the corruption can be halted, the woods healed. There's no need to shed innocent blood![[3-3 guardian murdered f]]


:: 4-1 Ashes e [Ignatius]
It is only in the ashes of the malevolence lurking here that the woods will have a chance to regrow. Why can't you see how necessary this is for the survival of both this forest and every other?[[4-1 Ashes f]]


:: 4-2 Return to the Heart e [Amelia]
I will not stand and watch as these woods are destroyed.[[4-2 Return to the Heart f]]


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius f [Ignatius]
As do I. If you will permit me the honor, I will go on ahead of you and announce you more formally.[[1-1 Meeting Ignatius g]]


:: 1-2 Audience f [Amelia]
We should seek out the Forest Guardian. The greenbond is our best route to gaining an understanding of this malady.[[1-2 Audience g]]


:: 2-2 Dour News f
Ignatius freezes mid-gesture and turns.[[2-2 Dour News g]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered f [Ignatius]
And how long would that take, Amélia? The corruption will claim every life in these woods before you go about attending to half of the creatures here! The Forest Guardian has fallen, and without the protections of the greenbond the corruption will only spread faster.[[3-3 guardian murdered g]]


:: 4-1 Ashes f [Amelia]
It is only necessary if there are no other choices![[4-1 Ashes g]]


:: 4-2 Return to the Heart f [Heart]
Go! Not far from here is a cave. Go, and do not tarry here wasting sentiment on an old druid.


:: 1-1 Meeting Ignatius g [Amelia]
My thanks, Ignatius.


:: 1-2 Audience g [Ignatius]
I should stay here; I will do what little I can to ease the pain.[[1-2 Audience h]]


:: 2-2 Dour News g [Ignatius]
Then the Guardian is dead. Another will not rise for a year and a day... we will have to make without the protections afforded by the Forest Guardian's magics.[[2-2 Dour News h]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered g [Amelia]
And what of the River Guardian?[[3-3 guardian murdered h]]


:: 4-1 Ashes g [Ignatius]
...Though I may bloody my hands with my actions today, I would not see you killed as well. Please, flee the woods while there's still time.[[4-1 Ashes h]]


:: 1-2 Audience h
Ignatius makes a circle with his thumb and forefinger and makes a sweeping gesture with his hand. A wish for luck.


:: 2-2 Dour News h [Heart]
...the River Guardian...[[2-2 Dour News i]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered h
Ignatius pauses for a moment, looking down at the ground before continuing.[[3-3 guardian murdered i]]


:: 4-1 Ashes h [action]
<Ignatius exits. #directors-cut: sun magic starts/spawns fires.>


:: 2-2 Dour News i [Ignatius]
My lord, you must conserve your strength! But... yes, the River Guardian may be willing to help us in this dire hour. Archdruid, rest now and I will attend to an audience with the River Guardian. My healing magics will hold until sunset, at least.


:: 3-3 guardian murdered i [Ignatius]
Those waters were tainted. I did... I did what I felt was necessary.[[3-3 guardian murdered j]]


:: 2-2 Dour News j [action]
<Ignatius leaves.>


:: 3-3 guardian murdered j [Amelia]
Gods, no... The River Guardian's magics were our last hope. You've doomed these woods, Ignatius.[[3-3 guardian murdered k]]


:: 2-2 Dour News k [Amelia]
What do we do if the River Guardian refuses?[[2-2 Dour News l]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered k [Ignatius]
No, I've saved them! The corruption will spread faster than you could ever hope to heal it, Amélia. If we do not take action, this disease will not stop at the boundaries of these woods. And if you won't act, then I will.[[3-3 guardian murdered l]]


:: 2-2 Dour News l [Heart]
...then we perish.[[2-2 Dour News m]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered l [Amelia]
What... what are you planning to do?


:: 2-2 Dour News m
The Heart of the Woods grips his birchstaff with renewed vigor, but his gaze remains at a distance.[[2-2 Dour News n]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered m [actions]
<Ignatius leaves.>


:: 2-2 Dour News n [Heart]
Go to Ignatius' aid. His wards will keep the Heartsgrove safe until your return.[[2-2 Dour News o]]


:: 3-3 guardian murdered n [Amelia]
Ignatius! Gods, no... he's heading for the Heartsgrove!


:: 2-2 Dour News o [Amelia]
As you wish. I won't fail.
